### A Project for BostonHacks 2018

Basically a passcode but with gifs instead of digits. A matrix of 4x4 gifs will be created and also a hidden "gifcode" will be generated as well. We will distinguish the gifs that are contained in the password. Once this is done, the user will have to guess the gifcode. Each time the user is wrong, the system will give them a hint to help them break into our system and obtain root access (only at LamuelSoft).
