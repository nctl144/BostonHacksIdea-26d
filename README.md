Basically a passcode but with gifs instead of digits. A matrix of 4x4 gifs will be created, the user will be asked to set a "gifcode" by selecting 4 of the gifs (gifs can be repeated). Once this is done, the matrix will be shuffled and the user will be asked to log in to the system. If the user can remember their "gifcode", then they will be redirected to a screen that says some stuff. If they can not remember the passcode in 3 tries, they fail.
